# Change Log
As with most npm modules, this project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## [0.1.1] - 2015-09-29
### Deprecated
- Using `SIGINT` (`^C`) to signify end of input in standard input mode is deprecated, and will be removed in 1.0.0. Instead, use `^D` which means "end of file."

### Fixed
- Fallback on options specified with `-O` if the corresponding CLI option is not specified.
- Mark this module as preferred to be installed globally.
- Fix copyright and update maintainers in package.json.
- Fix links in HISTORY.md.
- Fix compiling directories whose paths contain backslashes (`\`) (#11).

## [0.1.0] - 2015-07-24
### Added
- Silent mode (`-s`, `--silent`) which disables printing unimportant messages (#3, pugjs/pug#1905).

### Changed
- Hierarchy mode (`-H`, `--hierarchy`) is made the default.
- Both versions of Pug and the CLI are printed with `-V` or `--version`.
- Unescaped Unicode line and paragraph separators (`U+2028` and `U+2029`) is now allowed in the `-O` option only when the input is considered to be JSON (#5, pugjs/pug#1949).
- Non-JSON object files are allowed for the `-O` option as long as it can be parsed with the `eval()` function.

### Deprecated
- Since the hierarchy mode (`-H`, `--hierarchy`) is made the default, the
  option is now redundant and will be removed in 1.0.0.

### Fixed
- Capitalization in help message is kept consistent.
- Fix grammar error in the help message (by @didoarellano).
- Fix watch mode in more than one level of dependency hierarchy (pugjs/pug#1888).

## 0.0.1 - 2015-06-02
### Added
- Initial release.
