1. Return the names of all the jedi classmates.
  select * from jedis;

Select all the SITH (red lightsabers from jedis)
 SELECT name FROM jedis WHERE lightsaber_color = 'red';

There was an assassination by the Sith! All the green lightsaber owners need to be deleted from the records!
DELETE FROM jedis WHERE lightsaber_color = 'green';

A New Jedi emerges. Add "The unknown" with a "black" lightsaber who has 100 years training, never tempted by the dark side
INSERT INTO jedis (name, lightsaber_color, years_training, tempted_by_dark_side) VALUES ('The Unknown', 'black', 100, '0');

The new Jedi trains all of the blue light saber owners. They dobule their years_training instantly.
UPDATE jedis SET years_training = years_training * 2 WHERE lightsaber_color = 'blue';

The orange lightsaber owners attack the unknown in the night. Ultimate fail. Remove the orange lightsaber owners.
 DELETE FROM jedis WHERE lightsaber_color = 'orange';

 Concerned, The new Jedi converts the brown and purple lightsaber owners to blue, and doubles their training also...
 UPDATE jedis SET years_training = years_training * 2 WHERE lightsaber_color = 'brown' OR lightsaber_color = 'purple';

 The ultimate Jedi battle takes place. Sadly, all novice Jedi (good and bad) with < 20 years_training need to be deleted from our records.
 DELETE FROM jedis WHERE years_training < 20;

 The unknown one vanishes. Remove them from the records.
 DELETE FROM jedis WHERE name = 'The Unknown';
